# annotations-policy

This policy validates the labels of generic Kubernetes objects.

## Settings

The policy settings has the `criteria` field which define the logic operatation
performed with the `values` defined in the settings and the environment variables
defined in the resource:

```yaml
settings:
  criteria: "containsAnyOf"
  values:
    - example.com/application
    - cost-center
```

The `criteria` configuration can have the following values:

- `containsAnyOf`: enforces that the resource has at least one of the
  annotations in `values`.
- `doesNotContainAnyOf`: enforces that the resource does not have any annotation
  defined in `values` (denylist).
- `containsAllOf`: enforces that all of the annotations in `values` are defined in
  the resource.
- `doesNotContainAllOf`: enforces that the annotations defined in `values` are
  not all set together in the resource.
- `ContainsOtherThan`: enforces that the resource contains at least one annotation not in `values`.
- `DoesNotContainOtherThan`: enforces that the resource contains only
  annotations from `values` (allowlist).

The `values` field must contain at least one annotation name for
validation. Annotation names should be [valid annotation
names](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/#syntax-and-character-set)
per Kubernetes docs.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> An empty list of annotation names is not allowed.

If you require more complex annotations validation, consider the use
of [Kubewarden policy groups](https://docs.kubewarden.io/howtos/policy-groups).
With policy groups, you can combine multiple validations using complex logical
operators to function as a single policy.

## Rules operators logic tables

These are some tables to help you understand the logic of the operators:

### `containsAnyOf`
